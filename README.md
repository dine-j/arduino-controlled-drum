# Arduino Controlled Drum

2nd year, Introduction to Robotics project

## Description of the tasks

We had two tasks:
The first task was to play any rhythm on the drum, and the second one was to add a sensor so that the drum could react to user inputs.

As a bonus task, we also decided to couple this to a song analyser for the drum to play alongside a song.
